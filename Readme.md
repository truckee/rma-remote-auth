### Remote Member Authentication plugin

## This is a work in progress.

This WordPress plugin will, when completed, allow authentication of users against a remote host so that they may gain access to restricted content. The plugin takes advantage of the WordPress HTTP API to verify member passwords. A cookie is created on successful verification that is used to signify permission to access additional content.

The particular use case prompting this plugin was a church WordPress website that used a third-party church management system (e.g., Realm) for maintaining a member database. As of this writing Realm does not maintain member email addresses or passwords. If and when they or other such systems do this plugin may be useful.
